Common expressions can be differently written according to the type of
letter case (lower case, upper case, etc).
However, proper nouns (for example, institutions) should be written in
upper case (first letters of each non-stopword).

Examples of letter cases:

- Lower case:
    "natural language processing"
    "World Health Organization"

- Sentence case:
    "Natural language processing"
    "World Health Organization"

- Title case:
    "Natural Language Processing"
    "World Health Organization"
